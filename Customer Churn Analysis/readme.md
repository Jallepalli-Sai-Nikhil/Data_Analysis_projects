# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

The Telco Customer Churn Analysis project aims to identify the factors contributing to customer churn and calculate the churn percentage for a telecommunications company. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, we analyze the customer data to provide insights that can help the company reduce churn rates and improve customer retention strategies.

## Real-World Problem

### Problem Statement

Customer churn is a significant issue for telecommunications companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. High churn rates can lead to revenue loss and increased marketing costs. Understanding the reasons behind customer churn and identifying at-risk customers can help companies develop strategies to retain them.

### Objectives

- **Identify Churn Factors**: Analyze the data to uncover key factors contributing to customer churn.
- **Calculate Churn Percentage**: Determine the percentage of customers who have churned.
- **Visualize Insights**: Create informative visuals to help stakeholders understand the churn dynamics and make data-driven decisions.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project, `Telco-Customer-Churn`, contains the following key columns:

- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Churn`: Indicates whether the customer has churned (`Yes` or `No`).
- `Contract`: Type of contract the customer has.
- `MonthlyCharges`: Monthly charges for the customer.
- Additional demographic and service-related features.
